The following terms and conditions ("Terms") govern all use of the lexicoi.org website and all
content, services, and products available at or through the website.  Our Services are offered
subject to your acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein
and all other operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published from time to time by lexicoi
(collectively, the "Agreement"). You agree that we may automatically upgrade our Services, and
these Terms will apply to any upgrades. Our privacy policy can be viewed
[here](/organization-privacy-policy).

We refer to lexicoi Inc. collectively as “lexicoi” or “we” throughout this agreement.

Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using
any part of our Services, you agree to become bound by the Terms of this Agreement. If you do not
agree to all the Terms of this Agreement, then you may not access or use any of our Services. If
these Terms are considered an offer by lexicoi, acceptance is expressly limited to these Terms.

Our Services are not directed to children. Access to and use of our Services is only for those over
the age of 13 (or 16 in the European Union). If you are younger than this, you may not register for
or use our Services. Any person who registers as a user or provides their personal information to
our Services represents that they are 13 years of age or older (16 years or older in the European
Union).

Use of our Services requires a lexicoi.org account. You agree to provide us with complete and
accurate information when you register for an account. You will be solely responsible and liable for
any activity that occurs under your username. You are responsible for keeping your password secure.

#### Responsibility of Visitors.

lexicoi has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software,
posted to our Services, and cannot therefore be responsible for that material's content, use or
effects. By operating our Services, lexicoi does not represent or imply that it endorses the
material there posted, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful, or non-harmful. You
are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems
from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. Our Services may
contain content that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable, as well as content
containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors. Our Services may also
contain material that violates the privacy or publicity rights, or infringes the intellectual
property and other proprietary rights, of third parties, or the downloading, copying or use of which
is subject to additional terms and conditions, stated or unstated. lexicoi disclaims any
responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by visitors of our Services, or from any
downloading by those visitors of content there posted.

### Fees, Payment, and Renewal.

*   **Fees.** Some of our Services are offered for a fee  while
    other Services may be free with optional paid upgrades, such as a lexicoi.org plan ("Paid
    Services"). By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees, which we'll bill or
    charge you for in regular intervals (such as monthly, annually, or biennially), on a pre-pay
    basis until you cancel, which you can do at any time by contacting the relevant support team.

*   **Payment.** If your payment fails or Paid Services are otherwise not paid for on time, we may
    immediately cancel or revoke your access to the Paid Services. If you contact your bank or
    credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services, we may revoke
    your access to our Services in general.

*   **Automatic Renewal.** To ensure uninterrupted service, our Paid Services are automatically
    renewed. This means that unless you cancel a Paid Service before the end of the applicable
    subscription period, it will automatically renew, and you authorize us to invoice you or use any
    payment mechanism we have on record for you to collect the then-applicable subscription fee (as
    well as any taxes). Your Paid Services are renewed for the same interval of time. For example,
    if you purchase a lexicoi.org annual plan, you will be charged each year.

*   **Refunds.** While you may cancel a Paid Service at any time, refunds are issued in our sole
    discretion.

*   **Fee Changes.** We may change our fees at any time. When applicable, we may give you advance
    notice of the fee changes. If you don't agree with the fee changes, you can cancel your Paid
    Service.

#### Content Posted on Other Websites.

We have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, made
available through the websites and webpages to which lexicoi.org links, and that link to
lexicoi.org. lexicoi does not have any control over those non-lexicoi.org websites, and is
not responsible for their contents or their use. By linking to a non-lexicoi.org website,
lexicoi does not represent or imply that it endorses such website. You are responsible for taking
precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan
horses, and other harmful or destructive content. lexicoi disclaims any responsibility for any
harm resulting from your use of non-lexicoi.org websites and webpages.

#### Third Party Services.

You may enable services, products, software (like themes or plugins), or applications developed by a
third party or yourself (“Third Party Services”) on your site.

If you use any Third Party Services, you understand that:

*   Third Party Services are not vetted, endorsed, or controlled by lexicoi.

*   Any use of a Third Party Service is at your own risk, and we shall not be responsible or liable
    to anyone for Third Party Services.

*   Your use is solely between you and the respective third party (“Third Party”) and will be
    governed by the Third Party’s terms and policies. It is your responsibility to review the Third
    Party’s terms and policies before using a Third Party Service.

*   Some Third Party Services may request or require access to your (yours, your visitors’, or
    customers’) data. If you grant access, your data will handled in accordance with the Third
    Party’s privacy policy and practices. We do not have control over how a Third Party Service may
    use your data. You should carefully review Third Party Services’ data collection, retention, and
    use policies and practices before enabling Third Party Services.

*   Third Party Services may not work appropriately with your website, and we may not be able to
    provide support for issues caused by any Third Party Services.

*   If you have questions or concerns about how a Third Party Service operates, or need support,
    please contact the Third Party directly.

In rare cases, we may at our discretion, suspend, disable, or remove Third Party Services from your
account or website.

#### Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy.

As lexicoi asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual
property rights of others. If you believe that material located on or linked to by lexicoi.org
violates your copyright, you are encouraged to notify lexicoi in accordance with lexicoi's
Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") Policy. lexicoi
will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing
material or disabling all links to the infringing material. lexicoi will terminate a visitor's
access to and use of the website if, under appropriate circumstances, the visitor is determined to
be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of lexicoi or
others. In the case of such termination, lexicoi will have no obligation to provide a refund of
any amounts previously paid to lexicoi.

#### Intellectual Property.

This Agreement does not transfer from lexicoi to you any lexicoi or third party intellectual
property, and all right, title, and interest in and to such property will remain (as between the

trademarks of lexicoi or lexicoi's licensors. Other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos
used in connection with our Services may be the trademarks of other third parties. Your use of our
Services grants you no right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any lexicoi or third-party

#### Changes.

We are constantly updating our Services, and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms
under which our Services are offered. If we make changes that are material, we will let you know by
posting on one of our blogs, or by sending you an email or other communication before the changes
take effect. The notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new terms will
take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using our Services within the
designated notice period. Your continued use of our Services will be subject to the new terms.
However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms (including the
binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place when the dispute arose.

#### Termination.

lexicoi may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any time, with or without
cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. If you wish to terminate this Agreement or
your lexicoi.org account (if you have one), you may simply discontinue using our Services. All
provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive
termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity
and limitations of liability.

These Terms of Service were originally written in English (US). We may translate these terms into
other languages. In the event of a conflict between a translated version of these Terms of Service
and the English version, the English version will control.

#### Miscellaneous.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between lexicoi and you concerning the subject
matter hereof, and they may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized
executive of lexicoi, or by the posting by lexicoi of a revised version.

If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to
reflect the parties' original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and
effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof,
in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof.

You may assign your rights under this Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be
bound by, its terms and conditions; lexicoi may assign its rights under this Agreement without
condition. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their
successors and permitted assigns.
