        Though we make and sell educational tools, our primary purpose and goal is not to make
        money.  Our goal is to remove barriers in the educational process.  In order to do this we
        follow a three step process outlined below.

    <div class="w-third">
      <div>
        <div class="b tac">Step one</div>
        We gather feedback from teachers, administrators, students and parents on problems with
        education. These can range from accessibility, to grading, to attendance.

    <div class="w-third">
      <div>
        <div class="b tac">Step two</div>
        Once we have feedback, if we have a tool that we believe can fit the use case we recommend
        that. Otherwise we getin the process of making a new tool or improving an existing tool.

        <div class="b tac">Step three</div>
        Finally, once complete we release the tool to the person who requested it and tell all of
        our users about the new tool. Profits generated from sales of our tools are used to fund
        research and development into new tools.
